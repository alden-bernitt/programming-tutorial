<h1>Programming Basics</h1>

<main>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        At its core, <dfn>programming</dfn> is the practice of writing
        instructions for a computer to <i>execute</i> (perform). Thus, a
        <dfn>program</dfn> is a sequence of instructions, usually
        written by a <i>programmer</i> (e.g. <em>you</em>), with the
        intent of having a computer execute those instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although it is often said that computers are "smart", they are, in
        fact, quite dumb. Computers are only capable of executing instructions
        <em>exactly</em> as given to them by the programmer. Therefore, it is
        the job of smart programmers to make computers to do smart things.
    </p>

    <h2>Programs</h2>
    <p>
        As previously stated, a program is a sequence of instructions for a
        computer to execute. We most often write programs as text stored in
        text files. In Python, we give these text files a ".py" file
        extension (as in "hello.py"), and invoke a Python <i>interpreter</i>
        to run the program on our behalf. A text file containing a Python program
        is often referred to as a <i>script</i>. As an example,
        let's take a look at the ubiquitous "Hello, world!" program,
        written in Python.
    </p>
    <div class='snippet'>
        <div class='filename'>hello.py</div>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code>print(<span class='str'>"Hello, world!"</span>)</code>
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        This program consists of one single <i>statement</i>. Even if you've
        never programmed before, you can probably guess what this program
        does: it prints the text "Hello, world!". Rather than printing the
        text onto a piece of paper using a device such as a printer, however,
        this program prints to what is known as <i>standard output</i>
        (often abbreviated as <i>stdout</i>). If you run this program on a
        <i>terminal</i>, such as the Windows <i>Command Prompt</i>, you'll
        find that standard output is connected to the terminal's display.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the "Hello, world!" program consists of a single statement,
        our programs usually consist of many, many statements.
        In the most basic setting, a program executes one statement at a time
        in the order that the statements are written. Once the last statement
        has been executed, the program <i>terminates</i> (completes). In
        Python, we place each statement on its own line.

                            it using a terminal.

    <h2>Python Specifics</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, we discuss some details that are specific to
        programming in Python, along with some issues that you may across when
        running Python programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Statements</h3>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, each statement in Python sits on its own line,
        without any preceding <i>whitespace</i> characters. The term
        "whitespace" refers to characters such as spaces and tabs. Trying to
        run a program that violates this rule will result in an error message
        being displayed on the terminal. The following example shows a
        program violating this rule and the resulting terminal output. Note
        that the second statement in the program is preceded by a single space
        character.
    </p>

    <div class='snippet'>
        <div class='filename'>line_error.py</div>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code>print(<span class='str'>"Line 1"</span>)</code>
<span class='lnum'>2</span><code> print(<span class='str'>"Line 2"</span>)</code>
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>$</span><kbd>python3 line_error.py</kbd>
<samp> File "/home/alden/test/test.py", line 2
    print("Line 2")
IndentationError: unexpected indent</samp>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        However, there is no issue with placing multiple empty lines between
        statements, as shown in the following example.
    </p>

    <div class='snippet'>
        <div class='filename'>blank_lines.py</div>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code>print(<span class='str'>"Line 1"</span>)</code>
<span class='lnum'>2</span>
<span class='lnum'>3</span><code>print(<span class='str'>"Line 3"</span>)</code>
</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Errors</h3>
    <p>
        If it hasn't already, there will come a time when you try to run a
        program and receive an error message instead. While these error
        messages may be annoying and hard to understand, they will become much
        easier to read as you gain more knowledge and experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the errors you will encounter may seem trivial. You may wonder
        why the computer can't use "common sense" to understand what your
        intentions are. Even if the computer were capable of such a thing, you
        would surely be much more annoyed if the computer were to guess your
        intentions incorrectly and execute a program erroneously. For better or
        worse, working with computers is a very exact science, so we must learn
        to cope.
    </p>

                <p>
                    All of the following statements contain some kind of error. Try
                    running them in the interpreter to see what kind of error
                    messages get displayed. See if you can correct the statements
                    so that they run properly.
