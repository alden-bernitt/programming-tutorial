<h1>Flow Control: Branching</h1>

<main>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Just like how we make decisions to do one thing over others everyday,
        nearly every useful program must eventually choose to do different
        things depending on various factors. In this guide, we will discuss
        some of the various ways in which we can write a program to make
        decisions.

                    A navigation app might choose to give the user different
                    routes depending on factors such as traffic congestion.

                <li class='frame'>
                    A video game may choose to take a special action if the
                    player's character's hit points drops to zero or below.
                    This action may include displaying a "game over" screen.

                    The computer within a car may turn on an LED indicator if

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>
        As you develop as a programmer, the programs you write will
        continually increase in complexity. To help programmers convey information
        to other programmers (or their future selves), almost every programming language
        provides a mechanism for writing <i>comments</i>. <dfn>Comments</dfn>
        are messages that are included inside of the program but are not executed
        by the computer. Comments are intended to assist human readers of the program
        in understanding what the program is doing and how the program works.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, comments are indicated using a <kbd>#</kbd> character.
        Any text following that character are ignored by the interpreter
        until the end of the current line. In the interpreter's eyes, the
        <kbd>#</kbd> and everything after it on that line do not exist.
    </p>

                    <p>
                        Comments should be used to clarify what your
                        intentions are with the section of the program
                        that you are commenting on. Consider the following
                        example.
                    </p>

                    <div class='snippet'>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code class='comment'># Print a table of the first three numbers and their squares.</code>
<span class='lnum'>2</span><code>print(<span class='lit'>1</span>, <span class='lit'>1</span> <span class='op'>**</span> <span class='lit'>2</span>)</code>
<span class='lnum'>3</span><code>print(<span class='lit'>2</span>, <span class='lit'>2</span> <span class='op'>**</span> <span class='lit'>2</span>)</code>
<span class='lnum'>4</span><code>print(<span class='lit'>3</span>, <span class='lit'>3</span> <span class='op'>**</span> <span class='lit'>2</span>)</code>
</pre>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class='frame'>
                    <p>
                        Comments should not simply repeat what the code
                        is doing. The code itself is sufficient to convey
                        that information, and at that point the comment does
                        nothing but clutter your code.
                    </p>

                    <div class='snippet'>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code class='comment'># Assign 1 to x</code>
<span class='lnum'>2</span><code>x <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='lit'>1</span></code>
</pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        That is, comments should convey what your code is
                        <em>intended</em> to do, not what it <em>does</em>.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li class='frame'>
                    <p>
                        The bottom line is that any comment that aids in
                        understanding a program is a <em>good</em> comment.
                        Any comment that detracts from the understanding of
                        the program is a <em>bad</em> comment.
                </li>

                <li class='frame'>
                    <p>
                        Comments can be used while your developing your
                        program to temporarily ignore or replace sections
                        of code. Consider the following example.
                    </p>

                    <div class='snippet'>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code>a <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='lit'>4</span> <span class='comment'>#input('Enter the first number: ')</span></code>
<span class='lnum'>2</span><code>b <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='lit'>8</span> <span class='comment'>#input('Enter the second number: ')</span></code>
<span class='lnum'>3</span><code>print(<span class='str'>'a + b ='</span>, a <span class='op'>+</span> b)</code>
</pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        By commenting out the <code>input()</code>
                        statements and replacing them with literals, you can
                        continually run the program to test different formats
                        for the <code>print()</code> statement until you find
                        one that you like, without bothering with re-entering
                        values every time you run the program...just don't
                        forget to uncomment the code once you're finished
                        testing.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Boolean</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the data types mentioned in the
        <a href='variables.html'>Data and Variables</a> guide, Python
        provides the <i>bool</i> data type (short for <i>boolean</i>).
        This data type consists
        of only two values: <code>True</code>, and <code>False</code>.
        Boolean values are operated on using <i>logical operators</i>.
        Python's logical operators are listed in the following table.
    </p>

                        If you are ever having trouble determining the result of
                        an <code>and</code> or <code>or</code> expression,
                        consider the following statement.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "I will give you a passing grade if you
                        write this paper <em>or</em> pass the final exam."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        There are two conditions, which we can represent using
                        boolean values (i.e. True or False)

                        <ol>
                            <li>You wrote the paper</li>
                            <li>You passed the final exam</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on these two conditions, we are able to draw a
                        conclusion: <em>you passed the class</em>. This
                        conclusion is true if you actually passed the class
                        and false otherwise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which conditions have to be true in order to get
                        a passing grade? In this case, fulfulling either of the
                        conditions (or both) is required. That is, the
                        statement "I received a passing grade" will be true
                        in the case that you wrote the paper (i.e. condition 1
                        is true), you passed the exam (i.e. condition 2 is
                        true), or both. This is the meaning of boolean
                        <em>or</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now consider this statement.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "I will give you a passing grade if you
                        write this paper <em>and</em> pass the final exam."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Which conditions have to be true in order to get a
                        passing grade in this case? You must fulfill
                        <em>both</em> conditions. That is, the statement
                        "I received a passing grade" will only be true in

                        true. In any other case, that statement is false. This
                        is the meaning of boolean <em>and</em>.

                        Note that we can compare strings using comparison
                        operators such as <code>&lt;</code> and
                        <code>&gt;</code>. These operators compare strings
                        using <i>lexicographical ordering</i>, which is the
                        technical way of saying that they are compared using
                        alphabetical order. Since "apple" comes before "bear"
                        in the dictionary, the expression
                        <kbd>"apple" &lt; "bear"</kbd> evaluates to
                        <samp>True</samp>.

                        As a general rule, only compare values of the same data
                        type. Failing to follow this rule runs the risk of
                        producing obscure bugs and unexpected results.
                        In particular, note the result of the following
                        expression.

                        You may have assumed that the expression
                        <code>"1" == 1</code> would evaluate to
                        <samp>True</samp>. However, in Python and many other
                        programming languages, this is not the case. This is
                        because the value <code>"1"</code> is a <i>string</i> and
                        the value <code>1</code> is an <i>int</i>. You may
                        wish that the computer would just understand what you
                        mean in this case, but consider if we had tried to
                        compare the string <code>"a"</code> instead of
                        <code>"1"</code>. Should the expression
                        <code>"a" == 1</code> evaluate to <samp>True</samp> or
                        <samp>False</samp>? The simple
                        fix is to avoid comparing values of different
                        data types in the first place.

                        Suppose you have a variable named <var>num</var> that
                        is storing an integer value. Suppose that you want to
                        write an expression that will test whether
                        <var>num</var> is storing either of the values -1 or 1.
                        A common mistake is to write the expression as follows.
                    </p>

                    <div class='terminal'>
<pre class='contents'>
<span class='prompt'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><kbd>num == -1 or 1</kbd>
</pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Reading this statement aloud may sound correct:
                        "num is equal to -1 or 1".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Remember, however, that logical operators such as
                        <code>or</code> must only have boolean operands.
                        The left operand of the <code>or</code> operator
                        is the result of the expression <code>num == -1</code>,
                        which is, indeed, a boolean. However, the right operand
                        is the value <code>1</code>, which is an integer. The
                        result of this expression is probably not what you
                        intended, and is therefore a bug.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The correct way to write this expression is as follows.
                    </p>

                    <div class='terminal'>
<pre class='contents'>

                    <p>
                        Try running both of these examples in the interpreter
                        to see what results you get back. Try various values
                        for <var>num</var>. The assignment <code>num = 0</code> is
                        a good starting point.

    <h2>Branching</h2>

    <p>
        Up to this point, every program we have written executes the same
        exact sequence of statements from beginning to end every time it is
        run. In this section, we will introduce some ways to tell a program to
        change the statements it executes based on a set of conditions.
        Choosing to
        execute a set of statements based on a set of conditions is
        known as <i>branching</i> or <i>flow control</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>If</h3>

    <p>
        The most fundamental branching statement is the <i>if-statement</i>.
        An if-statement is composed of a boolean expression and a sequence of statements.
        The boolean expression is called the <dfn>condition</dfn> of the if-statement,
        and the sequence of statements is called the <dfn>body</dfn>.
        If the condition of an if-statement evaluates to <code>True</code>,
        then the body
        executes. Otherwise, the body is ignored and the program
        begins executing directly after the last statement in the body.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, we indicate the statements that belong to the body of an
        if-statement by indenting those statements with whitespace -- usually
        a single <i>tab</i> character. The
        first un-indented statement following an if-statement marks the end
        of the body.

                        Consider the following program portion. Assume that the

                        integer value.

<code>print(<span class='str'>"See you next time!"</span>)</code>

                    <p>
                        In this example, the <em>condition</em> is the 
                        boolean expression <code>num == 7</code> (which is
                        either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <em>body</em> consists of the two statements
                        <code>print("Your number is 7.")</code> and
                        <code>print("That's a lucky number!")</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the program reaches this if-statement, the value
                        of <var>num</var> will be compared to <code>7</code>.
                        If they are equal (i.e. the condition is equal to
                        <code>True</code>), then the program prints the following output.

                    Both tabs and spaces can be used to indent the statements

                    Although you have the freedom to use whichever characters you
                    choose, we recommend against mixing
                    tabs and spaces for your indentations. Our recommendation
                    is to use a single tab character per level of indentation.

                    <p>
                        Be consistent with your indentation.
                        Once an indentation has been found, Python expects all
                        following indentations to use the same spacing as the
                        original indentation. Failing to do so results in an error.

    <h3>Else</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes, instead of choosing whether or not to execute a set of
        statements based on a condition, we might want to choose to execute
        one set of statements if the condition is <code>True</code>, and a
        different set of statements if the condition is <code>False</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To provide this functionality, Python offers the <i>else-statement</i>.
        An else-statement must be preceded by an if-statement. Else-statements
        are written exactly like if-statements, except that a condition is not
        included. The body of an else-statement only executes
        if the condition of the corresponding if-statement is <code>False</code>.

    <h3>Elif</h3>

    <p>
        Many decisions involve choosing one alternative over several others.
        Python offers an <i>elif-statement</i> that can be used in conjunction
        with an if-statement to represent these alternatives within your
        programs.
    </p>

    <p>
        An elif-statement is written in exactly the same fashion as an if-statement;
        it includes a condition and a body. Like an else-statement, an
        elif-statement must be preceded with an if-statement. The condition of an
        elif-statement represents one of the alternatives that you are interested
        in testing for.
    </p>

    <p class='frame'>
        We can place as many elif-statements as we like after an if-statement.
        We can also include an else-statement at the end of the list of
        elif-statements. This else-statement would be executed in the scenario
        that the conditions of every associated <code>if</code> and
        <code>elif</code> evaluated to false.

                        Avoid duplicating the exact same bodies across multiple
                        if and/or elif statements. Instead, combine those
                        branch statements into a single branch statement
                        by using an <code>or</code> operator.

                        Consider the following example.

                        Avoid duplicating the same group of statements across
                        the bodies of every if/elif/else statement. Instead,
                        we can remove those statements from each body and add

    <h3 id='nested_if'>Nested If</h3>

    <p>
        There are some situations where we are interested in making a
        sub-decision following a decision. Recall that the body of an
        if-statement is composed of a sequence of statements.
        Since the if-statement is itself a statement, we can place an
        if-statement <em>within</em> the body of another if-statement.
        We call such a statement a <i>nested if-statement</i>, or simply
        a <i>nested if</i>.
    </p>

    <p class='frame'>
        In programmer parlance, an if-statement that is part of the body of
        another if-statement is called an <i>inner-if</i>. The containing
        if-statement is referred to as the <i>outer-if</i>. An if-statement
        that is not part of the body of another if-statement is called a
        <i>top-level if</i>.
    </p>

    <p class='frame'>
        Although excessive nesting should be avoided for readability purposes,
        there is no limit to the number of times an if-statement can be nested.

                    <p>
                        In the USA, there is an association called the MPA
                        which is responsible for assigning "maturity" ratings
                        to films. The purpose of these ratings is to inform
                        parents about the content of movies so that they can
                        make better decisions about what to show their children.
                        Movies that are rated "R" are intended for viewers that
                        are ages 17 and over.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Suppose we are writing a program that allows users to
                        view movies on-demand. Write the portion of the program
                        that asks the user for their age. If they are 17 or older,
                        allow them access to the movie by printing the message
                        <samp>Access granted.</samp>. Otherwise, deny them
                        access by printing the message

                        whether the user is allowed to drink. If the user is

                        Python offers a command for generating random integers.
                        To use this command, insert <code>import random</code>
                        into the first line of your program. Once that is done
                        you can use the command <code>random.randint(x, y)</code>,
                        which will produce a random integer between <var>x</var>
                        and <var>y</var>, including <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.
                        For example, the command <code>random.randint(1, 3)</code>
                        will produce one of the values 1, 2, or 3 at random.
                        Don't worry if you don't entirely understand the meaning
                        of all of this; just use the <code>random.randint()</code>

                        Some of the eariest versions of video games were called
                        "text-based adventure games", where the player would
                        control a character by entering text commands using
                        a keyboard (see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork'>Zork
                        </a> for one popular game in this genre).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Write a program which simulates a dialogue between a
                        player and a character that might
                        take place in one of these text-based games. Start the
                        program by printing a line of dialogue from the character.
                        Then, provide the player with a list of
                        dialogue options to choose from in response to the
                        character. Read the player's response from standard input
                        and print one more line from the character. Implement the
                        program such that the
                        character gives a unique response according to the
                        dialogue option chosen by the player.

                        example, by repeating the string <code>"*~.~*"</code>,
                        we can create a nice banner to underline some text,
                        as is done in the following example.

                        to repeat the banner base, and a string representing the
                        text to be underlined. Create a banner by repeating the

                        the banner with the text centered above it. If the
                        length of the banner is shorter than the length of the

                        If the text or banner cannot be perfectly centered,
                        make sure that the offset is towards the left side.
                        See the sample below for an example of this

                        the banner is offset by one character towards the
                        left, causing one character to remain on the left of
                        the banner and two on the right.

                    <span class='label'>Monty Hall Problem (Challenging)</span>

                    <p>
                        There is a famous brain teaser in mathematics known as
                        the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem'>Monty Hall Problem</a>.
                        The problem is named after the host of a TV game show in
                        which the contender would be given three doors to
                        choose from. Behind one of the doors was a car, and
                        behind two of the doors was a goat. The contender's
                        goal was to choose the door with the car behind it.
                        However, after the contender chooses a door, the host
                        reveals the contents of one of the doors (other than
                        the chosen door) that contains a goat. The contender
                        is then given a final choice of keeping the door they
                        chose originally, or switching to the remaining
                        unrevealed door.

                    <p>
                        Your task is to write a program that plays this game
                        with the player. The program, taking on the role of
                        the host, randomly chooses a winning door (i.e. a
                        door with a car behind it). After a door has been
                        chosen, the user is asked to select a door. Once the
                        user selects a door, the program reveals one of the
                        doors (different from the door that the user selected).
                        Once the door is revealed, the program asks the user
                        if they would like to switch their door to the remaining
                        unrevealed door. Once the user has made their choice,
                        the program prints the results of the game.

                                door they selected and does not have the prize.

                        Python offers a command for generating random integers.
                        To use this command, insert <code>import random</code>
                        into the first line of your program. Once that is done
                        you can use the command <code>random.randint(x, y)</code>,
                        which will produce a random integer between <var>x</var>
                        and <var>y</var>, including <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.
                        For example, the command <code>random.randint(1, 3)</code>
                        will produce one of the values 1, 2, or 3 at random.
                        Don't worry if you don't entirely understand the meaning
                        of all of this; just use the <code>random.randint()</code>
                        command for now.
