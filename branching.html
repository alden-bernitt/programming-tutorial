<h1>Flow Control: Branching</h1>

<main>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Just like how we make decisions to do one thing over others everyday,
        nearly every useful program must eventually choose to do different
        things depending on various factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Up to this point, every program we have written executes the same
        exact sequence of statements from beginning to end every time it is
        run. In this guide, we introduce a way to tell a program to change the
        statements it executes based on a set of conditions. Choosing to
        execute a set of statements based on a set of conditions is
        known as <i>branching</i>.

                    A navigation app might choose to give the user different
                    routes depending on factors such a traffic congestion.

                    A video game may choose to take a special action if the
                    player's character's hit points drops to zero or below.
                    This action may include displaying a "game over" screen.

                    The computer within a car may turn on an LED indicator if
                    the fuel drops below a certain threshold.

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>
        As you develop as a programmer, the programs you write are going to
        continually increase in complexity. To help humans, such as yourself
        or someone you are working with, understand these programs, just about
        every programming language provides a mechanism for writing
        <i>comments</i>. <dfn>Comments</dfn> are messages that are included
        inside of the program but are not executed by the computer. Comments are
        intended to convey information between the humans reading the program
        in order to aid in understanding how the program works and what the
        program is doing.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Python, comments are indicated using a <kbd>#</kbd> character.
        Any text following that character are ignored by the interpreter
        until the end of the current line. In the interpreter's eyes, the
        <kbd>#</kbd> and everything after it on that line do not exist.
    </p>
