<h1>Using A Python Interpreter</h1>

<main>
    
    <p>
        Before starting this guide, make sure that you have a Python
        interpreter installed. If you are unsure of whether you have an
        an interpreter installed, refer to the
        <a href='setup.html'>Installing Python</a> guide.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpreter Basics</h2>

    <h3>Starting the Interepreter</h3>
    
    <p>
        To start your Python interpreter, open a terminal (such as Windows
        <i>Command Prompt</i>), and enter <kbd>python3</kbd>.
        When the interpreter starts, you will likely be greeted by a message.
        This is what we see when we run our interpreter.
    </p>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>$</span><kbd>python3</kbd>
<samp>Python 3.13.2 (tags/v3.13.2:4f8bb39, Feb  4 2025, 15:23:48) [MSC v.1942 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
<samp>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</samp>
<span class='prompt'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Using the Interpreter</h3>
    
    <p>
        The <samp>&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp> is called the <dfn>primary prompt</dfn>,
        and indicates that the interpreter is waiting for you to enter some
        input. We can oblige by entering a <code>print()</code> statement as
        follows.
    </p>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><kbd>print("Hi, Python!")</kbd>
<samp>Hi, Python!</samp>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you can see, the interpreter has displayed the text that we placed
        inside of the parentheses of the <code>print()</code> statement. You
        can also enter mathematical expressions, and the interpreter will
        evaluate them and display the results to us.
    </p>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><kbd>3.14 * 13 * 13</kbd>
<samp>530.66</samp>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        We will learn much more about the types of statements we can write in
        Python in later guides.
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, to end the interpreter session, we can enter <kbd>exit()</kbd> or
        <kbd>quit()</kbd>.
    </p>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><kbd>quit()</kbd>
<span class='prompt'>$</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            Some interpreters do not require the parentheses for <kbd>exit()</kbd>
            and <kbd>quit()</kbd>; Simply entering <kbd>exit</kbd> or <kbd>quit</kbd>
            will suffice.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Bonus Features</h2>

    <p>
        Python interpreters come with some handy additional built-in features.
        While these features will probably not be useful to you now, they may
        be in the future, so we've added them here just so that you know they
        exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you've already entered some commands into the interpreter, you can
        use the <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> key to scroll through those commands,
        starting from the most recent. You might use this to re-enter a
        previously entered command without having to re-type the whole thing.
        Once you've scrolled to your desired command, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
        again to re-enter it.
        If you've scrolled back into your history some, and you want to
        return to more recent entries, you can use the <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> key.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can enter <kbd>F1</kbd> to open an interactive help menu within the
        interpreter. The help menu will provide plenty of information on how to
        get started using it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pressing <kbd>F2</kbd> allows you to browse your command history
        without displaying any results from statements nor any prompts
        (e.g. <samp>&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp>).
        This can be useful, for example, for copying a block of commands that
        you entered in the interpreter, and pasting them into a Python script
        so that they can be run again automatically (more on scripts in a later
        guide).
    </p>

    <p>
        By pressing <kbd>F3</kbd>, you can enter "paste" mode, which
        allows you to paste blocks of text into the interpreter. You could
        use this to paste a sequence of commands copied from a script, for
        example, directly into the interpreter. By pressing <kbd>F3</kbd>
        again, we can exit paste mode. If you notice the prompt has changed
        to the <i>secondary prompt</i> (usually <samp>...</samp>), pressing
        <kbd>Enter</kbd> one more time should cause the interpreter to run all
        of the commands you pasted, and then display the primary prompt again.
