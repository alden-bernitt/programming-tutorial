    <h1>Running Python Scripts</h1>
    <p>
        In this guide, we will discuss how to run Python scripts from a
        terminal. As a prerequisite, make sure that you've already successfully
        <a href='setup.html'>installed Python</a>, and you know how to open a
        terminal, such as the Windows <i>Command Prompt</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Create A Python Script</h2>
    <p>
        If you haven't already, download a suitable text editor for writing
        Python scripts. Once that's done, create a new file (name it
        "test.py"), and enter the following Python code.
    </p>

    <div class='snippet'>
        <div class='filename'>test.py</div>
<pre class='program-text'>
<span class='lnum'>1</span><code>print(<span class='str'>"It works!"</span>)</code>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        Save the file and make note of its
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)'>file path</a>.
        On Windows, this is done by first locating the file in the
        <i>File Explorer</i>. Then, right click the file and select
        "Properties". The file path is listed next to the "Location" field
        (it might be helpful to copy it from here).
    </p>

    <img class='diagram'
        src='images/run/filepath.png'
        alt='The location of a file, as shown in the Properties menu'
        width='596'
        height='127'/>

    <h2>Run A Python Script</h2>

    <p>
        Now that you've created the Python script, open a terminal and navigate
        to the directory (folder) that it's saved in. Assuming you are on a
        Window's computer, and the script is saved in the directory located at
        <kbd>C:\Users\anon\scripts</kbd>, you can do this by using the
        <kbd>cd</kbd> command and entering (or pasting) the path as shown.
    </p>

    <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>$</span><kbd>cd C:\Users\anon\scripts</kbd>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        Many terminals will update the prompt to indicate which directory
        you're in, so you should be able to tell that the command worked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, enter the command <kbd>python3 test.py</kbd>. If you see
        the output <samp>It works!</samp>, then congratulations! You've
        successfully written and run (presumably) your first Python script!
    </p>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            You might also be able to use the <kbd>python</kbd> command in
            addition to <kbd>python3</kbd>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            The key takeaway is that when using a terminal, you must
            navigate to the directory that your script is located in
            to run it. Failing to do so will result in an error message. We
            got the error message shown below on the Command Prompt
            on Windows 11.
        </p>
        <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<samp>python3: can't open file 'C:\\Users\\anon\\scripts\\myscript.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory</samp>
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            Alternatively, instead of navigating to the directory of your script
            as shown previously, you can simply enter the full path of the script
            directly with the <kbd>python3</kbd> command as follows.
        </p>

        <div class='terminal'>
<pre>
<span class='prompt'>$</span><kbd>python3 C:\Users\anon\scripts\test.py</kbd>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
