    <h1>Data and Variables</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        While all programs can be viewed as a sequence of statements, there is
        another key element involved: data. <strong>Data</strong> are the
        values that we operate upon within our statements.
    </p>

                    <p>
                        Consider the following expression:
                        <kbd>4 + 5</kbd>
                        <br/>
                        The "operation" is addition, the "data" are
                        the values 4 and 5.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class='frame'>
                    <p>
                        In the "Hello, world!" program from the
                        <a href='basics.html'>Programming Basics</a>
                        guide, we used the single <kbd>print</kbd>
                        statement <kbd>print("Hello, world!")</kbd>. The
                        data we used with this statement was the text
                        "Hello, world!".
                    </p>

    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        In accordance to how we view data in the real world, programming
        languages use <strong>data types</strong> to distinguish between the
        various types of data. Each data type is defined by a set of possible
        values and a set of <strong>operations</strong> to perform on those
        values.
    </p>

     <div class='aux-section-group'>
        <div class='dropdown-section'>
            <h3 class='dropdown'>Examples</h3>

                    <p>
                        When we count objects (such as sheep), we do so
                        using a set of numbers known as
                        <strong>integers</strong>. Integers include values
                        such as <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>9001</kbd>,
                        <kbd>0</kbd>, and <kbd>-69</kbd>. Operations on
                        integers include addition <kbd>+</kbd>,
                        subtraction <kbd>-</kbd>, and multiplication
                        <kbd>*</kbd>
                        <br/>
                        Notably, integer values do <strong>not</strong>
                        include values such as <kbd>0.5</kbd> and the
                        square root of 2 (often denoted
                        <kbd>sqrt(2)</kbd>). Operations that are
                        <strong>not</strong> defined on integers include
                        the usual version of division <kbd>&divide;</kbd>
                        (this is because, for example, the result of
                        dividing the integers <kbd>1</kbd> and
                        <kbd>2</kbd>, that is <kbd>1 &divide; 2</kbd>,
                        results in a value that is not an integer).
                    </p>

    <p>
        Python provides a rich set of data types to make the job of the
        programmer easier. As we introduce the following data types, note that
        we do not describe all of the data types provided by Python, nor do we
        describe all operations included with each data type. However, take
        heart in that many of these data types and opertions will be introduced
        in later guides, and we will give you the tools necessary to perform
        your own research when the time comes.

            As you read the following sections, it may be helpful to try your
            own examples using a
            <a href='interpreter.html'>Python interpreter</a>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Integer</h3>

    <p>
        The integer, or <strong>int</strong>, data type represents the set of
        integers, and includes values such as <kbd>1</kbd>,
        <kbd>9001</kbd>, <kbd>0</kbd>, and <kbd>-69</kbd>. In mathematics,
        this set might be denoted <kbd>{..., -1, 0, 1, ...}</kbd>.
        Python provides the expected operations on integers, along with a few
        obscure ones.

                <td><kbd>//</kbd></td>
                <td>Floor Division</td>

            </tr>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        The most noteworthy of these are the <kbd>//</kbd> and <kbd>%</kbd>
        operators. The <kbd>//</kbd> operator performs an operation known as
        <strong>floor division</strong>. The result of this operation
        is equal to the division of the first operand by the second
        <em>rounded down</em> (i.e. towards negative infinity) to the nearest
        integer. The <kbd>%</kbd> operator, called the <strong>modulo</strong>
        operator, essentially produces the <em>remainder</em> of the first
        operand divided by the second operand.
    </p>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            We recommend testing <kbd>//</kbd> and <kbd>%</kbd> using a
            positive and negative value, a negative and positive value, and
            two negative values. You may be surprised at the results.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            You might find that the <kbd>%</kbd> operator produces strange
            results when one or both of the operands are negative. This is
            because the operation <kbd>a % b</kbd> actually performs the
            calculation

            <span class='display'><kbd>a - b * floor(a / b)</kbd></span>

            When <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd> are both positive, this is
            identical to calculating the remainder of a &divide; b.
        </p>

        <p>
            You do not need to memorize this. Just understand that you may not
            get the result you expect when using <kbd>%</kbd> with negative
            operands.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the <code>floor()</code> function produces the value
            of <code>a / b</code> rounded down (i.e. towards negative infinity).
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Float</h3>

    <p>
        The <strong>float</strong> data type represents the set of real
        numbers. This set includes integer values, such as the ones shown
        previously, as well as values with decimal points, such as <kbd>1.5</kbd>,
        <kbd>-99.99</kbd>, and <kbd>3.14159</kbd>. The float data type
        supports mostly the same operations as the int data type. Notably,
        float values also support division.

    </table>

    <h3>String</h3>

    <p>
        The final data type we will discuss in this guide is the
        <strong>string</strong> data type. A string is simply a sequence of
        characters, and represents text. Strings in Python are denoted by
        characters enclosed in either single quotes (<kbd>'</kbd>), or double
        quotes (<kbd>"</kbd>). Examples include <kbd>"Beans"</kbd>,
        <kbd>'To be, or not to be'</kbd>, and <kbd>""</kbd> (this is
        a sequence of zero characters, and is referred to as an
        <strong>empty string</strong> or <strong>null string</strong>).
    </p>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            What happens if we want to place quotes <em>within</em> a string? How
            will the interpreter know which quotes are supposed to close a string
            and which quotes are supposed to be part of the string? Consider the
            example <kbd>"I had a "great" time"</kbd>. The Python interpreter
            would see two strings in this case: <samp>"I had a "</samp>, and
            <samp>" time"</samp>. These questions are answered in the next section.
        </p>
    </div>

            <tr>
                <th scope='col'>Op</th>
                <th scope='col'>Description</th>
                <th scope='col'>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><kbd>+</kbd></td>
                <td>Concatenation</td>
                <td><samp>'Py' + 'thon' = 'Python'</samp></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><kbd>*</kbd></td>
                <td>Repetition</td>
                <td><samp>'Py' * 3 = 'PyPyPy'</samp></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        The <strong>concatenation</strong> operation combines its two string
        operands into one string by appending the second string directly to
        the end of the first. The <strong>repeat</strong> operation takes one
        string operand and one integer operand, and produces a new string by
        repeating the original string the specified number of times.
    </p>

    <p>
        What if we want a string to contain special characters such as a tab
        character or line break character? What if we want to include quotes
        <em>within</em> the string itself? To accomplish this, we use
        something called an <strong>escape sequence</strong>. In Python, along
        with many other programming languages, an escape sequence begins with
        a <kbd>\</kbd> character followed by one or more other characters
        which specify the special character.

                        use this string with a <kbd>print()</kbd>
                        statement to print a string containing quotes.

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>
        Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in computer
        programming. Conceptually, In Python, a <strong>variable</strong> is a
        name that we give to a storage unit which stores a single value of a
        single data type. That is, we <strong>initialize</strong> a name with
        a storage unit containing a value. You might visualize this as asking
        Python to give you a box, placing the value inside, and sticking a
        label on it with your chosen name. In Python, this entire process is
        done using the <strong>assignment</strong> (<kbd>=</kbd>) operator.
        Once we have created a variable, we are able to assign any new value of
        any data type to it, and we are able to use it as an operand as if it
        were a regular value.

            Although in mathematics <kbd>=</kbd> is used to mean
            <em>equality</em>, many programming languages do not share these
            semantics. This is the reason why statements such as
            <code>x = x + 1</code> make sense in Python and other programming
            languages. In words, this statement means "retrieve the value
            stored in <code>x</code> and add <code>1</code> to it, then
            <em>assign</em> the name <code>x</code> to that new value.
        </p>
        <p>
            If <code>x</code> originally contained the value <code>4</code>
            before the statement executed, it will contain the value
            <code>5</code> after.

            It is sometimes useful to distinguish between variables and
            literals. Simply put, <strong>literals</strong> are plain values
            such as <kbd>7</kbd> (an integer literal), or <kbd>3.14</kbd> (a
            float literal), and <kbd>"Python"</kbd> (a string literal).
            Variables, on the other hand, refer to the names which store
            values, such as <var>num</var>, <var>pi</var>, or <var>language</var>.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Variable Names</h3>

    <p>
        There are rules as to what constitutes a valid
        <strong>identifier</strong> (i.e. name). Although these rules in Python
        are rather complicated, let it suffice to say that identifiers may
        only contain letters, digits, and underscores (<kbd>_</kbd>), and
        must begin with either a letter or underscore. Furthermore,
        <strong>reserved words</strong> may not be used as identifiers. We
        will learn many reserved words in time, but if you are curious now,
        you can reference the
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords'>
        official Python website </a> for a list.
    </p>

    <div class='frame'>
        <p>
            Although not strictly necessary, we <em>highly recommend</em> that
            you adhere to the following naming conventions when naming your
            variables.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <div class='list-title'>Do</div>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use only English letters (capital and lowercase A through Z),
                    numbers, and underscores.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Begin an identifier with a lowercase letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <div class='list-title'>Do Not</div>
            <li>
                <p>Begin or end an identifier with an underscore (e.g. <var>_num_</var>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use foreign characters (e.g. <var>すうじ</var>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use predefined names (e.g. <var>print</var>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Begin an identifier with a capital letter (e.g. <var>Num</var>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use all capital letters (e.g. <var>FIRST_NAME</var>)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            As always, some exceptions will be made in some circumstances, but

    <h2>Expressions</h2>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Expressions</strong> are a group of operations that evaluate
        to a single value. We can assign the results of expressions to
        variables, or use them in statements like the <code>print()</code>
        statement. Expressions can contain variables, literals, or a mixture
        of both.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like in mathematics, Python specifies a precedence for its
        operators (recall
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations'>PEMDAS</a>
        ). Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with
        lower precedence.  Like in mathematics, operations that are enclosed in
        parentheses are treated with the highest precedence. A table displaying
        the precedence of some of Python's operators is shown below.
    </p>

    <table class='oporder-table'>
        <caption>Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest)</caption>
        <thead>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><kbd>()</kbd></td>
                <td>Parentheses</td>

            <tr>
                <td><kbd>**</kbd></td>
                <td>Exponentiation</td>

    <h2>Input</h2>

    <p>
        So far, every program we've written executes exactly the same every
        time it's run, which is boring. Now that we know about variables, we
        can take input from the user and store it in a variable to alter the
        results of a program. In Python, we can <strong>read</strong> (i.e.
        receive) user input by using the <code>input()</code> function, and store
        it in a variable as is done with the statement
        <code>name = input()</code>. When this statement is executed, the
        program will wait until text is available on
        <strong>standard input</strong>, and then store that text as a string in
        <var>name</var>. If we are running this program at a terminal, we can
        make text available to standard input by typing into the terminal and
        pressing the <kbd>Return</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>Enter</kbd>) key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Choosing the variable identifier <var>name</var> suggests that the
        programmer is expecting the user to supply the program with some kind
        of name. The user, however, has no way of knowing this. To solve this
        problem, we can supply a <strong>prompt</strong> to the user to guide
        them when entering a value. This is done by including a string value
        in between the parentheses of <code>input()</code>. For example, it
        may be helpful to use <code>input("Please enter your first name: ")</code>.
        This prints the given text to standard output before waiting for the
        user's input. By including this prompt, the programmer can communicate
        to the user the kind of input that is expected from them.

            In order to complete the following projects, you will need to
            read values from standard input using the <code>input()</code>
            function described previously. It is important to note that
            the result of <code>input()</code> is always a string value.
            However, some of these projects require you to perform integer
            or float operations on these values. In order to do this, you
            will have to convert the original values into the correct data
            type using the <code>int()</code> and <code>float()</code>
            functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, suppose that we have already stored an input
            string in a variable named <var>x</var>. To convert <var>x</var>
            to an integer, we could execute the statement <code>x = int(x)</code>.
            Similarly, to convert <var>x</var> to a float, we could execute the
            statement <code>x = float(x)</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Another fact that will be useful in completing these projects is
            that we can provide multiple values to <code>print()</code> by
            separating them with commas. Each of these values will be written
            (i.e. printed) to standard output with a space inserted after each
            value. For example, <code>print('One', 'Two', 'Three')</code> will
            print <samp>One Two Three</samp>.

                        Imagine you are developing a 2D game where two characters
                        must be within a certain distance in order to interact
                        with each other. Say we care about two characters, A and B.
                        Your goal is to read in four values from standard input,
                        representing the X coordinate of A, the Y coordinate of A,
                        the X coordinate of B, and the Y coordinate of B
                        respectively. Once this is done, calculate the distance
                        between A and B, and write it to standard output. If
                        you'd like, give names to your characters. Refer to
                        the sample below.

                        To perform this calculation, you'll need to find the
                        square root of a number. Luckily, Python provides a
                        function for that. To access the square root function,
                        type <code>import math</code> into the very first line
                        of your program. Once that's done, you can write
                        statements such as <code>x = math.sqrt(4)</code> to
                        use the square root function. Don't worry if you don't
                        understand the details of all of this right now, just
                        use the square root function as demonstrated for the
                        time being.

                    <p>
                        There is a theorem in mathematics called the Division
                        Formula which states that given any two integers
                        <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, there are unique
                        integers <var>q</var> and <var>r</var> such that
                        
                        <span class='display'>a = bq + r</span>

                        We call <var>q</var> the "quotient", and <var>r</var>
                        the "remainder".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, if <var>a</var> is 14 and <var>b</var> is
                        5, then we have

                        <span class='display'>14 = 5(2) + 4</span>

                        So the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 4.

                        Your task is to write a program that will read two

                        from standard input, and calculate the quotient and
                        remainder of <var>a</var> divided by <var>b</var>.
                        Once the quotient and remainder have been calculated,
                        write the division formula equation to standard output,
                        substituting the proper values for <var>a</var>,

                    <p>
                        Imagine we are moving a database of patient records
                        for a hospital from one system to another. Since
                        this process can potentially take a long time, we want
                        to display a loading bar to the user so that they can
                        track progress of the data transfer. We can simulate a
                        loading bar in standard output by printing a sequence of pipe
                        characters (<kbd>|</kbd>). We will say that 0 pipe
                        characters represents 0% loaded, and 50 pipe characters
                        represents 100% loaded (i.e. each pipe represents 100%
                        &divide; 50 = 2% load progress).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your job is to read two values from standard input
                        representing the total number of records to be
                        transferred and the number of records that have
                        already been transferred, respectively. Using these
                        values, print to standard output a loading bar using
                        pipe characters to indicate the current progress and
                        periods to indicate the remaining progress (round down to
                        the nearest 2%). For example, if 11% of the records have been
                        transferred, print five pipe characters followed by forty-five
                        periods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the loading bar, you must also
                        print some statistics of the data transfer. These
                        statistics will include the current number of records
                        transferred, the total number of records to be
                        transferred, and the percent progress (represented as
                        an integer). The progress percentage will be rounded
                        down to the nearest integer.
